# Credit Card Fraud Detection App

This project provides a **fraud detection application** built using `Streamlit`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `OpenAI`. The application predicts the probability of fraudulent transactions using multiple machine learning models and offers detailed explanations to guide bank officials in decision-making. Additionally, the app generates **customer-friendly emails** to alert users about unusual activities.

## Features

- **Transaction Fraud Detection**:  
  Predicts fraud probabilities using models like **Decision Tree**, **XGBoost**, and **Logistic Regression**.
- **Multi-Model Support**:  
  Aggregates predictions from multiple models to calculate an **average probability**.
- **Interactive Interface**:  
  Allows users to **select transactions**, input or modify transaction details, and view predictions and visualizations.
- **Automated Explanations**:  
  Provides detailed fraud explanations using **OpenAI‚Äôs API**.
- **Customer Email Generation**:  
  Creates **personalized emails** to inform customers about potential fraud and suggested actions.
